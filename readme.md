The introduction of our work.



the main work we have done is to visualize the relationships in “Journey to the West” . The relationships in this novel include the relationship between husband and wife ,parents and children, brothers and sisters, friends, opponents and the superior and the subordinate. In our visualization, we use the picture to represent a person, a edge between nodes to represent the relationships between them, which will make it very clear to see the relationships in the novel.

The process of visualization.



In the initial interface, there are only some people who are older and some free points that seem to be irrelevant. We use dots in cool colors to represent male characters, dots in warm color to represent female characters. And the size and color of the dots are different to represent people who are in different positions.



When click on one node (picture), line between the new character and other former characters will be added automatically. Click on the dot again, its children will disappear, including the line.

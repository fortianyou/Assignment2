###3. Description of our visualization

Naruto is my favorite cartoon so I use the D3 to show the power distribution of Naruto. In order to show the relationship of the countries and the ninjas, I choose the layout of force-directed. I use the text to show the names of every country and every ninja so we can easily know what are the meanings of the nodes and their links. What's more, we use many functions that D3 gives us. These functions help us get a better understanding of the power distribution of Naruto. For example, when we drag the nodes, we can see that the nodes linked with the dragged one will change the color and the size. These functions help us get a better understanding of the power distribution of Naruto.

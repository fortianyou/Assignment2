#Assignment II: Network Visualization/Graph Drawing
 
##Description
 
###Data Obtainment :
+ First we search the source which we need on the Internet.
+ Second we select and summarize the data which we obtain from the Internet.
+ Third we format the data to a format which we need.
 
###Data Description :
+ Our data is about the Four big families which had lived during the period of the Republic of China. The Four big families are Chiang family, Soong family, Kung family and Chen family. They were responsible for much of China's management of finance, politics, economy, and law. We describe the relationship of the Four big families and show the introductions of every family and every person on our webpage. We hope that people can learn about the knowledge intuitively.
 
###Find Knowledge from the Visualization :
+ 1.We can learn about the introductions of every family and every person.
+ 2.We can learn about the relationship of the Four big families. And we can also learn about the principle members of every family.
+ 3.We can learn about the connections through marriages among them. And we can also learn about the different circumstances of the Four big families. The Chiang family, Soong family and Kung family are still booming today. They have many family members. But Chen family is destitute. We search the source of their family members difficultly.
 
##Data Preprocess
+ We obtain the data which includes the relationships of the Four big families, the introductions of the Four big families and their family members and the photos of the Four big families' members. We format the data to a json document in the first place. Then we format the data to a js document because we can use the data more conveniently without the server software. This is our data preprocessing.

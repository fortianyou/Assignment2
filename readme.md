#Introduction of Assignment2：

###1.Motivation:
	When we start to do this homework, we want to describe the connection between people,so we find the relationship data on the Internet which is stored in the file graph.json. 
Considering that the complicated relationship between people is hard to display by trees or some other structures, we decided to use a dynamic plotting to express our data. In the plotting, nodes are used to present the people and the lines between two nodes show the connections. In this way, we could find the connections between people and some circles of friends easily.	

###2.Process：
	Considering that we have never learned JS before. In order to do this work, we made several references for some educational books and many JS examples. Then, we use d3 force-directed layout to accomplish the visualization. By making each person as a node and signing the nodes by people’s names.

	When you select a node and drag it, the people whoever connected with it will move together. If you want to see connections clearly, then fix the selected node by setting the drop-down box on the upper-left corner.

###3.Function：
	As we can see, we could know connections between people directly and clearly. Imagining that when we lose a friend's contact information, we just need to search other people who are keeping contact with him or her. That is useful.

###4.Harvest：
	Not only did we get some basic knowledge about D3 and JS, but also we now have some original ideas for the last assignment.

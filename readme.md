#Figure diagram of Condor Trilogy




###Introduction

Condor Trilogy(射雕三部曲) had left deeply impression to thousands of people through several generations,however，the complex relationships among the hundreds of figures are too messy to grasp for us.Fortunately，the relationships of these figures can be better shown in the use of network visualization.Therefore, we select it as the topic of this assignment.
In this assignment, we will show hundreds of figures and the relationships among them in a whole page.

###Demonstration 
In order to help us grasp the relationships of figures from different novels, we use three kinds of colors that each one represent one novels.For there are enough close relationships between the figures of The Legend of The Condor Heroes(射雕英雄传) and The Return of the Condor Heroes(神雕侠侣)，compared with the ones of The Heaven Sword and the Dragon Sabre（倚天屠龙记）, we select two similar kinds of colors: light blue and deep blue to present them,while orange present the figures from the third novels.

###Data Source
The relationship between the characters are drawn from the Condor trilogy book.

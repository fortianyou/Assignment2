#__Introduction of our work__：

##**Introduction**：

   This is my telephone contacts. we can see the edges of the net has different sizes and color. The size is for the relationship of the two people, the larger the better relationship. And the color divides people to different relationship to me, there may be my classmates, families and colleagues.
If you want to get the number of someone you can move your mouse to the text and click the mouse you’ll find the name changes to the number of that people.
###__data__:
I use some sections of __my own contacts__ for the homework. it about 20 people, and the name is right but the number is not.
 
##**Function**：

If I want to find someone number, I need to click my mouse. This is the basic function.Sometimes I may lose connection with somebody of my contact. 
There are many situations ,for example, I lose his or her number or he had changed his number. Or their mobile phone didn’t work. 
So I can use the telephone contacts net to search who keeps the better relationship with him or her to know what’s the matter.

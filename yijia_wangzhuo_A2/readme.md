##data source
We use python to get the relationships from Yijia's [renren](http://www.renren.com/339805241) account,and the acount id is 339805241.

We got __name__, __gender__, __account id__ and some other informations. But we found it hard to get the __target__ from Renren, so we developd it by ourselves.You can see the source data in json file.
